# Gulp boilerlate

This is a skeleton template to help start building the front end of a website/app.


<strong>Step 1:</strong>

CD in the directory where gulpfile.js is stored.

Install the modules required to use gulp, these are used in our 'gulpfile.js' file. The modules required are declared in the 'package.json' file:

<i>npm install</i>

To install the modules type the following command: <i>npm install</i>

<strong>Step 2:</strong>

Next we need to run the build tool gulp.

Type the following command: <i>gulp</i>

Gulp will start and run any tasks setup in 'gulpfile.js'. It will watch for any changes in the /src directory and automatically compile the scripts and output them in public_html.

<strong>Step 4:</strong>

Make sure any js or css edits are made in the /src/ directory. GULP will output the final minified versions in the distribution/build directory.

Code away!!
